# Fireworks Audio Files

This directory contains audio files for the fireworks plugin:
- `rocket.mp3` - Rocket launch/whistle sound ✅ **INSTALLED**
- `explosion.mp3` - Explosion/burst sound ✅ **INSTALLED**

## Audio Status

✅ **Audio files are installed and ready to use!**

The plugin will automatically play these sounds during fireworks animations:
- Rocket sound plays when a firework launches
- Explosion sound plays when a firework bursts

Audio requires user interaction (click/keypress) to enable due to browser autoplay policies.

## Replacing Audio Files

You can replace these files with your own sounds:

1. Find royalty-free firework sound effects
2. Convert to MP3 format
3. Recommended: Keep files under 100KB for performance
4. Replace `rocket.mp3` and/or `explosion.mp3` in this directory
5. Reload the overlay page to use new sounds

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound?** Click anywhere on the overlay page to enable audio (browser requirement)
- **Wrong sounds?** Clear browser cache and reload the page
- **Audio too loud/quiet?** Adjust volume in the plugin settings UI
