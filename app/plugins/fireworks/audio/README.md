# Fireworks Audio Files

This directory should contain:
- `rocket.mp3` - Rocket launch/whistle sound
- `explosion.mp3` - Explosion/burst sound

## Adding Your Own Sounds

1. Find royalty-free firework sound effects
2. Convert to MP3 format
3. Recommended: Keep files under 100KB for performance
4. Place in this directory

## Fallback

If audio files are missing, the plugin will work silently without errors.
